Mobile-first approach

🎨 Features

Smooth font usage (Inter: 400, 600, 700)

💻 What I Learned

How to center content vertically and horizontally using align-items + justify-content

Proper use of Flexbox for arranging link cards

Using Google Fonts efficiently

Simple card UI design with consistent spacing and typography

📦 Code Snippet (Example)
.link-card {
display: flex;
justify-content: center;
background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 20%);
padding: 16px;
border-radius: 10px;
color: inherit;
text-decoration: none;
font-weight: 600;
}

.link-card:hover {
color: hsl(0, 0%, 8%);
background-color: hsl(75, 94%, 57%);
cursor: pointer;
}

📚 Continued Development

In the future, I want to:

Add animations to the hover state

Improve accessibility (ARIA, focus outlines)

Add dark/light theme support
